[0] Nokia 6610
[1] awesome phone choice . 
[2] after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative . 
[3] i was immediately interested in the 6610 . 
[4] i have used this phone for two months now . 
[5] not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . 
[6] if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more . 
[7] in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned . 
[8] the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent . 
[9] even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio . 
[10] if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are . 
[11] although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing . 
[12] the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press . 
[13] however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . 
[14] in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . 
[15] it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone . 
[16] one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 
[17] overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . 
[18] any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages . 
[19] nokia does not disappoint in this model . 
[20] go for it !
