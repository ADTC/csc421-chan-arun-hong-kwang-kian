[0] Nokia 6610
[1] do n't have the phone just commenting . 
[2] i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing . 
[3] the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia . 
[4] the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone . 
[5] my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset . 
[6] i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing . 
[7] i do n't really like bounce . 
[8] i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones . 
[9] battery life is good for a phone of this size . 
[10] but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing . 
[11] great screen and great sound . 
[12] ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ? 
[13] the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god . 
[14] the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) . 
[15] the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive . 
[16] my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . 
[17] nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary . 
[18] this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands . 
[19] ( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . ) 
[20] other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips . 
[21] finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier . 
[22] their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience . 
[23] if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
