[0] Nokia 6600
[1] What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
[2] With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
[3] Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
[4] The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
[5] Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
[6] Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
