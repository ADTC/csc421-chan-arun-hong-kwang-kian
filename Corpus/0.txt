[1] I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
[2] The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
[3] Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
[4] Why is this phone so great?
[5] Simple.
[6] It has it all.
[7] This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
[8] If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.
