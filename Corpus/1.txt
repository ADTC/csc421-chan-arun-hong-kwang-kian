[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
[2] 3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
[3] 6600 looks and feels nice.
[4] This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
[5] Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
[6] I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
[7] Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
[8] Goes ~3 days after a charge.
