[0] Nokia 6610
[1] glad to own . 
[2] i have had this phone for about 5 months . 
[3] i treat the battery well and it has lasted . 
[4] at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days . 
[5] it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls . 
[6] signal strength will affect the battery life . 
[7] frequent signal searches eat up battery power . 
[8] i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover . 
[9] i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at . 
[10] the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
[11] some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to . 
[12] the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
[13] the vibration is not top . 
[14] it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in . 
[15] i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it . 
[16] vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this . 
[17] so it was no loss . 
[18] overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 
[19] great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . 
[20] i do hope that they offer more faceplate options . 
[21] i am bored with the silver look .
