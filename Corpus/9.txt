[0] Nokia 6600
[1] This one has a good looking.
[2] It's oval and... nice.
[3] I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
[4] It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
[5] The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
[6] And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
[7] I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
[8] Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
[9] What's wrong with it?
[10] Is it really slow, or what?
[11] Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
[12] It's good.
[13] But not good enough for me.
[14] :! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
