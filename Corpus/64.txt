[0] Nokia 6610
[1] cool phone ! 
[2] like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program . 
[3] i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me . 
[4] pros : 
[5] small size . 
[6] i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it . 
[7] just make sure the keys are locked . 
[8] color screen is good . 
[9] it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . 
[10] the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . 
[11] navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . 
[12] battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . 
[13] cons : 
[14] not many . 
[15] the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . 
[16] pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? 
[17] please ! 
[18] is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
