[0] Nokia 6600
[1] The phone itself is pretty nice.
[2] Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
[3] Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
[4] But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
[5] You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
[6] Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
