[0] Nokia 6610
[1] incredibly pleased . 
[2] i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer . 
[3] prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider . 
[4] to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing . 
[5] my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them . 
[6] nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them . 
[7] first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint . 
[8] i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . 
[9] the phone is small , light , and very attractive . 
[10] the battery life is amazing . 
[11] the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones . 
[12] i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs . 
[13] i highly recommend this phone to anyone . 
[14] i 've yet to be dissappointed .
