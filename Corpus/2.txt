[0] Nokia 6600
[1] Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
[2] I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
[3] I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
[4] I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
[5] It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
[6] Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
[7] 1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
[8] My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
[9] I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
[10] Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
[11] 2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
[12] Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking.
[13] I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
[14] 3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
[15] There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
[16] The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
[17] I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
[18] Capacity is not a problem here.
[19] 4. The Build is just right.
[20] The phone is sturdy.
[21] I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
[22] Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
[23] This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
[24] 5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
[25] I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
[26] The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
[27] The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
[28] Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
[29] It has great upgradibility.
[30] I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net.
[31] Now that is neat.
[32] The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
[33] The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
[34] I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
[35] Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
[36] The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
[37] Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
[38] You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
[39] Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
[40] When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
[41] In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
[42] This makes for a great phone.
[43] Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
[44] gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
