[0] Nokia 6610
[1] so far i am more than pleased . 
[2] i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go : 
[3] pros : 
[4] size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you . 
[5] sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored . 
[6] speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch . 
[7] surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . 
[8] cons : 
[9] ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring . 
[10] the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 
[11] games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
