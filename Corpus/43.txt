[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
[2] Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.
[3] So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
[4] The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
[5] 2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
[6] 3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
[7] Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
[8] 3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
[9] The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
[10] 2) Phone is awfully slow.
[11] Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
[12] 3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
[13] Looks big in the display ads though.
[14] 4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
[15] There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
[16] 5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
[17] So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
[18] The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
