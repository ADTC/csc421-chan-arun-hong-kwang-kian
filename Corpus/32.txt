[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I used to work with t-mobile..
[2] i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!
[3] but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
[4] yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
[5] i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
[6] the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
[7] I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
[8] the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great!
[9] i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
[10] The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
[11] I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
[12] If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
[13] the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
[14] i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
