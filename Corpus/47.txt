[0] Nokia 6600
[1] INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
[2] Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
[3] Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.
[4] you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
[5] you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
[6] T610 supports only midi files.
[7] N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
[8] it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
[9] i'm having mine upgraded to capture endless video, which right now allows 10 secs.
[10] I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
[11] I love this phone.
