[0] Nokia 6610
[1] t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone . 
[2] nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear . 
[3] with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great . 
[4] the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . 
[5] one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a " worldphone " and can be used in europe , etc. 
[6] yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch . 
[7] the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . 
[8] therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet . 
[9] after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone . 
[10] bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it . 
[11] find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
