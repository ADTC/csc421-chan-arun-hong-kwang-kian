[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
[2] I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
[3] Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
[4] This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
[5] The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
[6] Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
