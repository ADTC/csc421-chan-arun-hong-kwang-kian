[0] Nokia 6600
[1] i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
[2] since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
[3] i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
