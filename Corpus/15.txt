[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
[2] It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
[3] You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
[4] Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
[5] Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
[6] The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
[7] The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
[8] The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
[9] All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
