[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
[2] A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
[3] 1) phone card calling feature.
[4] This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
[5] So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
[6] This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
[7] For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
[8] All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
[9] This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
[10] My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
[11] All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select "calling card call".
[12] 2) Low volume on regular answering.
[13] In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
[14] You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.
[15] Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
