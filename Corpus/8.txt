[0] Nokia 6600
[1] Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
[2] I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
[3] Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
[4] Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
[5] Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
[6] Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
