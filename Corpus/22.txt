[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
[2] Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
[3] So, do I recommend the 6600?
[4] Yes, certainly.
[5] But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
[6] The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
[7] The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.
[8] Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
[9] In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
