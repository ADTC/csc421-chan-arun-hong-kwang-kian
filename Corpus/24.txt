[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
[2] Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.
[3] It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
[4] Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
[5] Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.
[6] I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
[7] I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
[8] I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
[9] All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
[10] I think the interface is great.
[11] I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).
[12] In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
[13] I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
[14] If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
