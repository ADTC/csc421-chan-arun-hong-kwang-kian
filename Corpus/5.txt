[0] Nokia 6600
[1] Don't get me wrong.
[2] I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
[3] I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
[4] In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
[5] Now I'm back to Nokia to try their 6600 model.
