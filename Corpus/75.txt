[4] truly , i am quite impressed . . ! ! 
[5] this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . 
[6] on an average , you would charge it once a week . 
[7] the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . 
[8] i simply love this feature . 
[9] in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset . 
[10] the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport . 
[11] if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more . 
[12] the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . 
[13] no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .

[17] the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy . 
[18] the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff . 
[19] if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone . 
[20] however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone . 
[21] i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon . 
[22] i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
