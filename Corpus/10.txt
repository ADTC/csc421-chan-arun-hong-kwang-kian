[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
[2] While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
[3] What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
[4] The best features that I use most often are:
[5] 1) Great audio quality overall.
[6] Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
[7] 2) Camera phone.
[8] A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
[9] 3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
[10] The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
[11] 4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
[12] If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
[13] 5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
[14] This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
[15] 6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
[16] I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
[17] You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
[18] My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
[19] I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
[20] I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
[21] Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
