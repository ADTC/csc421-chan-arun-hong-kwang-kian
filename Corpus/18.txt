[0] Nokia 6600
[1] At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
[2] One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
[3] This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
[4] I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
[5] The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
[6] I could go on and on---but I won't!
[7] Go see for yourself.
[8] The ONLY bad thing?
[9] I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
