[0] Nokia 6610
[1] awesome phone , great prices on amazon.com . 
[2] i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular . 
[3] one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched ! 
[4] but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ... 
[5] almost there . 
[6] i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal . 
[7] i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along . 
[8] this is almost it but not quite but the price was right . 
[9] that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce . 
[10] it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . 
[11] what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge . 
[12] so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again . 
[13] but for now this will do . 
[14] oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam . 
[15] great phone .. . 
[16] great features .. .
