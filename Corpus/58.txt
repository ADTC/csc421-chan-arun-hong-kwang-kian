[0] Nokia 6610
[1] perfect . 
[2] anything this phone does , it does perfectly . 
[3] the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . 
[4] the speakerphone : 
[5] this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 
[6] as said before this works perfectly . 
[7] you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
[8] the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 
[9] you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . 
[10] only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . 
[11] the radio : 
[12] this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 
[13] this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly . 
[14] tri-band : 
[15] one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia . 
[16] i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 
[17] the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
[18] anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . 
[19] if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe . 
[20] sold in other parts of the world : 
[21] another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
[22] this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 
[23] or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe . 
[24] i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service . 
[25] able to use service in another country : 
[26] if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country . 
[27] you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country . 
[28] size and weight : 
[29] when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . 
[30] this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . 
[31] battery life : 
[32] the battery life on this phone is surreal . 
[33] it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby . 
[34] i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . 
[35] it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 
[36] this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . 
[37] the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . 
[38] overall , i highly recommend this phone . 
[39] it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
