[0] Nokia 6600
[1] The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
[2] The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
[3] The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
[4] The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
[5] But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.
[6] Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
[7] If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
[8] The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
[9] This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210
