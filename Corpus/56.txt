[0] Nokia 6610
[1] menu flaws ? mine could n't send text messages . 
[2] i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store . 
[3] when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there : 
[4] it defaulted to unchangeable email . 
[5] so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem . 
[6] i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't . 
[7] he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail . 
[8] so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours . 
[9] while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . 
[10] negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . 
[11] poor visibility on the keys . 
[12] you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
