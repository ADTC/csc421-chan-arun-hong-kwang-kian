[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
[2] Before buying, I'd urge you to actually use one and not just handle it in the store.
[3] On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
[4] As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
[5] And remember, this is a PHONE first and foremost which is where I have my biggest complaints...
[6] When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
[7] You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
[8] I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
[9] It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
[10] I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
[11] Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
[12] You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
