[0] Nokia 6610
[1] excellent , but only gsm ? 
[2] i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone . 
[3] as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band . 
[4] for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
