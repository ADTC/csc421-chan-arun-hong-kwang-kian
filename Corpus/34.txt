[0] Nokia 6600
[1] This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
[2] I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
[3] I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
[4] The interface is simple to use.
[5] I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
[6] I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
[7] I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
[8] The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
[9] On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
[10] Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
[11] As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
[12] Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.
[13] For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
[14] On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
[15] And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
[16] With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
