[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
[2] If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
[3] This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
[4] The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
[5] The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
[6] Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
[7] I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
[8] Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
[9] If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.
