[0] Nokia 6600
[1] OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
[2] For example, the memory card is under the battery.
[3] The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
[4] This is representative of the entire phone operation.
[5] Not for the impatient.
[6] If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
[7] Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
[8] APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
[9] No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
[10] On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac.
[11] Me likes.
[12] The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
[13] The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
[14] I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
[15] DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
[16] I've had no problems w/ this phone.
[17] STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
[18] As for appearance, well, that's subjective.
[19] Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
[20] It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
[21] Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
[22] Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.
[23] Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
[24] MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
[25] First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
[26] Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
[27] Still not sure?
[28] If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
[29] This is no small deal.
[30] If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
[31] RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
[32] The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
[33] The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
[34] The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
[35] As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
[36] The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
[37] Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
[38] It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
[39] The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
[40] GAMES - Java.
[41] Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
[42] In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
[43] IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
[44] There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
[45] The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.
[46] The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
[47] If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated.
[48] A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
[49] Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.
[50] Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
[51] It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.
[52] When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
[53] I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
