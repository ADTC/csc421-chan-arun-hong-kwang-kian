[0] Nokia 6600
[1] Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
[2] It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
[3] I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.
[4] The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
[5] I like the size and shape.
[6] It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
[7] The only problem is the size of the keys.
[8] My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
[9] They really are awfully small.
[10] Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
[11] It also works just fine for international calls.
[12] It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
[13] It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
[14] I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
[15] Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
[16] I never get dropped calls.
[17] It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
[18] I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
