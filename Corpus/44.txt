[0] Nokia 6600
[1] my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
[2] all the other features are gravy.
[3] i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
[4] so, right out of the box i had issue.
[5] namely, it wouldnt sync.
[6] after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
[7] there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
[8] i may have been up for this 10 years ago, but i just want a phone that works at this point.
[9] i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
[10] but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
[11] if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
[12] i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
[13] but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
[14] this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
[15] if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
