[0] Nokia 6600
[1] I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
[2] UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
[3] I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
[4] Photos are pretty darned good!
[5] DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
[6] My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
[7] The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
[8] I mean, they're short!
[9] Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
[10] I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
[11] Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
[12] This is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.
[13] Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
[14] It would not hang up on calls.
[15] Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
[16] Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
[17] But beware of the bugs; they are major!
