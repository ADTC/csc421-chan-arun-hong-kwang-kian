[1] I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
[2] You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
[3] Give each friend a different ringtone.
[4] Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
[5] A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
[6] Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
