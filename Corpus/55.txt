[0] Nokia 6610
[1] great phone , but no warranty ! 
[2] this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it . 
[3] nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon . 
[4] we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . 
[5] i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
