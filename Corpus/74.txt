[0] Nokia 6610
[1] a great phone!
[2] nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality . 
[3] i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough . 
[4] it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 . 
[5] you do take your chances with this phone .
